# JDL Carrier Rate Service

A Cloudflare Worker that implements a Shopify carrier rate service to provide customm shipping rates for JDL's Shopify store.

## Features

- **Local Delivery**: Free delivery for Miami-Dade and Broward County zip codes

## Register an App and the Carrier Service with Shopify

A Shopify app needs to be created and installed in the JDL store in order to get the admin api token needed to register this custom carrier service using the admin api. This is best done in the [Shopify dev dashboard](https://dev.shopify.com/dashboard). Use the "Start from Dev Dashboard" option and specify:

- App name: JDL Custom Shipping
- scope(s): write_shipping

After creating the app, select the distribution method using the link in the right sidebar (opt for one store only). Then install the app in the JDL store.

Once the app has been installed, fetch an admin api access token using the [client credential grant flow](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-tokens/client-credentials-grant) as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://jdl-industries-inc-aviation.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/access_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=CLIENT_ID_FROM_DEV_DASHBOARD" \
  -d "client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_DEV_DASHBOARD"
```

After deploying, register the carrier service with Shopify using the Admin API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://jdl-industries-inc-aviation.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-01/carrier_services.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: ADMIN_API_TOKEN_FROM_RESPONSE_ABOVE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "carrier_service": {
      "name": "JDL Custom Shipping",
      "callback_url": "https://carrier-rate-service.jdlindustries.workers.dev/rates",
      "service_discovery": true,
      "carrier_service_type": "api",
      "format": "json"
    }
  }'
```

## Configuration

All configuration is stored in `src/config.ts`:

| Export                | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `LOCAL_DELIVERY_ZIPS` | Set of Miami-Dade and Broward County zip codes |
| `BOX_CONFIGS`         | Box configurations for packing algorithm       |
| `HANDLING_FEES_CENTS` | Ground and air handling fees                   |
| `PRIORITY_FEE_CENTS`  | Priority handling surcharge                    |

## Routing Logic

1. **Local Delivery**: Destination zip in Miami-Dade/Broward list → Free local delivery
2. **US Domestic**: US destinations → FedEx rates with handling fees
3. **International Military**: Non-US + `_customer_type=international_military` → FedEx International
4. **Freight Forwarding**: All other international → Placeholder rate for manual follow-up

## API Endpoints

### `POST /rates`

Shopify carrier service callback.

### `GET /health`

Health check endpoint. Returns `{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "..." }`.

## Priority Handling Extension

A Shopify checkout UI extension is included in `extensions/priority-handling/`. This adds a checkbox to checkout that enables priority handling.

When a customer checks the box:
1. `_priority_handling: "true"` is added to all cart line items
2. The carrier service detects this and adds $30 to all shipping rates
3. Delivery dates reflect expedited fulfillment (ships within 1 business day)

See `extensions/priority-handling/README.md` for deployment instructions.

## Project Structure

```
/src
  index.ts                 # Hono app entry point
  config.ts                # App configuration (fees, zip codes, FedEx settings)
  /handlers
    rates.ts               # Main rate handler
  /services

    packaging.ts           # Box packing algorithm
    routing.ts             # Routing decision tree
    leadtimes.ts           # Lead time calculations
    *.test.ts              # Unit tests
  /types
    shopify.ts             # Shopify types
    fedex.ts               # FedEx API types
    config.ts              # Configuration types
/extensions
  /priority-handling       # Checkout UI extension for priority handling option
```

## Handling Fees

- **Ground Services** (FEDEX_GROUND, GROUND_HOME_DELIVERY): $30 per order
- **Air/Express Services**: $125 per order
- **Priority Handling**: +$30 for expedited fulfillment (ships within 1 business day)

## Error Handling

- FedEx API errors or timeouts → HTTP 500 (triggers Shopify fallback rates)
- No shippable items → HTTP 200 with empty rates array
